Payday 2 mod that tracks damage and kills from Copycat's "Ricochet" ability 

This mod tracks how many times you proc your Ricochet (which, surprisingly, is different from how often you dodge), how much damage you deal via this method, and how many times you actually kill someone via Ricochet. It then prints out your results at the end of the heist. Isn't that wonderful!
